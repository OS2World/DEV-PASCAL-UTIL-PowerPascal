Version: 0.002 - Very crude, and simple.

Power Pascal is a fully 32-bit, native Pascal compiler for OS/2 2.0.
It requires an 80386SX or compatible microprocessor, and OS/2 2.0,
or subsequent versions, and Microsoft Assembler Version 6.0 (NOT 6.1!)

Power Pascal was created specifically for OS/2 using MASM 6.0 and
Turbo Pascal version 7.0.  Currently it generates a text-mode application
which can be run either in a full screen or in a window.



  What Pascal/2 CAN DO:

    Simple Procedures  (No parameters, Up to 512)

    Global Variables ( Up to 512 )

    Byte, Integer, and Longint Variables

    Limited String Constants

    Write,WriteLn,Emit  ( Very simple OUTPUT routines )

    Simple expressions

    For loops

    While loops

    Until loops

    If then else

    Block Statements


  What Pascal/2 CAN'T DO: (YET)

    Local Variables (Stack Variables!)

    Type definitions (VERY important)

    Procedure of function Parameters (of ANY type)

    GOTO & labels

    Floating point math

    Standard Library functions

    Libraries, DDE's, etc.


Current Goals:

  Self compile,  Standalone generation of .EXE files, no matter how goofy
